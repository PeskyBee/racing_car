# Racing Car
Hacking RC car to apply self-driving concept for car racing

### RC Car

For this project we bought an rc car. We had multiple options to solve the problem of controlling the wehical from PC (Mac). We could:
  
  * Follow multiple [tutorials](http://www.instructables.com/id/Autonomous-Control-of-RC-Car-Using-Arduino/) to create RC car controlled by Arduino. This would require to solve a problem of how to transmit the signal from the PC to the car (the first problem remains unsloved). We'd had to use either USB or wi-fi modules.
  * Make a radio transmitter on PC. Most of the guides explain how to make a radio transmitter (but only for FM frequency) or using oscillator to find a frequency of the car and basically using brute force checking each and every value until car moves.
  * The best thing is that RC car already has everything - car mechanics and radio transmitter. We only need to hack it. So we bought some pins and prototyping print-board for the POC.
  
### Next steps
